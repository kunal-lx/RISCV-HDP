Design c code on Godbolt - (a) Counter (b) Matrix-Multiplication

__________________________________________

Highlights of two code snippets:

 one related to matrix multiplication (RISC-V assembly), 
 
 and the other related to a calculator program (Arduino assembly)


In the provided assembly code, there are two different programs. Let's analyze each program separately.

Program 1: Matrix Multiplication (RISC-V Assembly)

.LC1:
  .string "Multiplication of given two matrices is:"
.LC2:
  .string "%d\t"
.LC3:
  .string "Total time taken in seconds %d:\n"

mulMat(int (*) [2], int (*) [2]):

  # ... (matrix multiplication logic)
Highlights:
Print Statements:

.LC1: Print statement for "Multiplication of given two matrices is:"
.LC2: Format string for printing integers with a tab character.
.LC3: Print statement for "Total time taken in seconds %d:\n"

Function Logic:

mulMat function performs matrix multiplication.


Program 2: Calculator Program (Arduino Assembly)

.LC0:
  .string "Enter two 4-bit binary numbers as decimal (A and B): "
.LC1:
  .string "%d %d"
.LC2:
  .string "Enter the operation (+, -, *, /, &, |, ^): "
.LC3:
  .string " %c"
.LC4:
  .string "Error: Division by zero"
.LC5:
  .string "Invalid operation"
.LC6:
  .string "Result: %d\n"

main:
  # ... (calculator program logic)
Highlights:
Print Statements:

.LC0: Print statement for "Enter two 4-bit binary numbers as decimal (A and B): "

.LC1: Format string for reading two decimal integers.

.LC2: Print statement for "Enter the operation (+, -, *, /, &, |, ^): "

.LC3: Format string for reading a character.

.LC4: Print statement for "Error: Division by zero"

.LC5: Print statement for "Invalid operation"

.LC6: Format string for printing the result.

Calculator Logic:

The program reads two decimal numbers and an operation, performs the operation, and prints the result.


Conclusion:
The two programs are distinct and serve different purposes. The first program (mulMat) is a matrix multiplication routine in RISC-V assembly, and the second program (main) is a simple calculator program written in Arduino assembly. Each program has its set of print statements, format strings, and specific logic.
